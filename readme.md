#The Universal Upload and Embed Tool
This small PHP utility automatically uploads HTML and image files into a folder one level up from its own current home and generates iFrame embed code in specified pixel dimensions.

For obvious reasons, unless you want to become a free web host to anyone and everyone, some basic security precautions -- including a properly configured robots.txt and PHP.ini file -- are probably in order. The submission page is also easily configurable for IP address or password based submission validation in Javascript.
